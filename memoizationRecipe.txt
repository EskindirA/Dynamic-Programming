Try to visualize recursive solutions in terms of a tree,
whats great about a tree is its already recursive.
    1. Make it work
        1.1 Visualize the problem as a tree
        1.2 Implement the tree using a recursion
        1.3 Test it
        - Have a solution even if its slow. 
        - There is a big difference in a code that is slow
          and a code that is wrong.  
    2. Make it efficient 
        2.1 Add a memo object
        2.2 Add a base case to return memo values
        2.3 Store returned values into the memo
