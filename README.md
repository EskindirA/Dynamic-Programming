# Dynamic Programming

This repository contains implementation of dynamic programming algorithms in Typescript. 

## What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic programming is an algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. The solutions to the subproblems are stored in a table, so they can be used to solve larger problems. Dynamic programming is especially useful for problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, meaning that the solution to the problem can be built from the solutions to its subproblems.
